```

## Data
Data come from LCA program disclose file of [The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance) from 2016 to 2020.
[Data](Data) folder contains all xlsx files. Because the file names of The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR are inconsistent, I rename the file to the consistent name. 
The total observations in the data file are over 300 million.
  - [LCA_cleanred.csv](Data/LCA_cleaned.csv) is the cleaned data by data wrangling. If you could not open this file, please rerun [LCA_Data_Wrangling.R](LCA_Data_Wrangling.R) R file 
  to regenerate the LCA_cleaned.csv file.
